A fork of [a-tarasyuk/react-webpack-typescript-babel](https://github.com/a-tarasyuk/react-webpack-typescript-babel) with whatever changes I make. For instance, `eslint`.

## Starting the development server

```shell
npm start
```

## Building the `bundle`

```shell
npm run build
```

## Type-Checking the repo

```shell
npm run type-check
```

And to run in --watch mode:

```shell
npm run type-check:watch
```
